I am a researcher in social affective psychology and neuroscience. My interests are in the topics of emotions, social interactions, and dynamic perceptions of the world.

Check out my blog for tutorials I've used and organized to study, behind-the-scenes of my work in graduate school, and personal thoughts on psychology research and interventions.

In projects, you can find detailed information on all the projects I've done so far.
