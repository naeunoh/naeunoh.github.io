I am a researcher in social affective psychology and neuroscience. My interests are in the topics of dynamic perceptions of the world, emotions, and social interactions. I aim to explore how we understand the natural social world (e.g. social relationships, memory, narratives) and how affect interacts with that process, identify the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms utilizing real-world modelling, and expand  translational research psychopathology (e.g. anxiety, depression, personality disorders related to emotions and interpersonal issues).

Check out my blog for tutorials I've used and organized to study these topics, behind-the-scenes of my work in graduate school, and personal thoughts on psychology research and interventions.

In [projects](/projects), you can find detailed information on all the projects I've done so far.
