  title={Brain connectivity during social exclusion differs depending on the closeness within a triad among older adults living in a village.},
  author={Kim, H., Kwak, S., Baek, E. C., Naeun Oh, Baldina, E., Youm, Y., & Chey, J.},
  abstract={Social exclusion occurs in various types of social relationships, from anonymous others to close friends. However, the role that social relationships play in social exclusion is less well known because most paradigms investigating social exclusion have been done in laboratory contexts, without considering the features of individuals’ real-world social relationships. Here, we addressed this gap by examining how pre-existing social relationships with rejecters may influence the brain response of individuals experiencing social exclusion. Eighty-eight older adults living in a rural village visited the laboratory with two other participants living in the same village and played Cyberball in an Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner. Utilizing whole-brain connectome-based predictive modeling, we analyzed functional connectivity (FC) data obtained during the social exclusion task. First, we found that the level of self-reported distress during social exclusion was significantly related to sparsity, i.e. lack of closeness, within a triad. Furthermore, the sparsity was significantly predicted by the FC model, demonstrating that a sparse triadic relationship was associated with stronger connectivity patterns in brain regions previously implicated in social pain and mentalizing during Cyberball. These findings extend our understanding of how real-world social intimacy and relationships with excluders affect neural and emotional responses to social exclusion.},

  title={Psychological well‐being and salivary markers of inflammation: The moderating effect of age.},
  author={Lee, S., Chey, J., Ahn, W., Woo, C. W., Youm, Y., Kim, H., Naeun Oh, Park, H., Gim S., Lee E., & Choi, I.},
  abstract={Increasing evidence suggests a significant impact of higher psychological well-being (PWB) on health outcomes; however, such associations have been studied exclusively in middle-aged to older adults. This study examined the aging effect on PWB measures as well as the moderating effect of age on the link between PWB and inflammation, using salivary markers by comparing the younger adults (n = 127; Mage = 22.98 years) versus older adults (n = 75; Mage = 75.60 years). Older adults showed significantly lower levels of PWB, particularly regarding purpose in life and personal growth. Moreover, higher purpose in life was associated with lower salivary IL-1ß and IL-6 (b = 0.83, p < .001; b = 0.81, p < .01) only in the older adult group but not in younger adults. These findings highlight the potential buffering effect of the sense of living well on physiological pathways in later life.},

  title={Neural Pattern Signature of Social Exclusion Predicts Loneliness in Older Adults},
  author={Naeun Oh},
  abstract={Social isolation is a critical factor that impacts our mental and physical health in late-life. A specific instance of social isolation is the experience of being ignored or unnoticed by others, namely social exclusion. As the brain is the key organ for forming and maintaining salutary connections with others, understanding the brain mechanisms of social exclusion is important for understanding psychological processes that would complement the existing self-report measures. In addition, examining the relationship between the neural signature response of social exclusion and loneliness outcome can provide insight into the social cognitive aspect of loneliness. This study aims to identify a neural pattern signature of social exclusion in older adults, using multivariate pattern analysis of neural activations during a Cyberball task, and to verify loneliness-related individual differences in the signature. A predictive model was developed to distinguish between a social exclusion and inclusion condition, using a widely distributed neural activation pattern of 88 older adults. The fMRI pattern classifier distinguished social exclusion and inclusion with an accuracy of 0.632 and AUC of 0.693. Voxel-level and region-level feature importance analysis demonstrated that areas contributing most to the prediction are the bilateral inferior parietal lobe, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, amygdala, and the ventral striatum. In relation to individual differences in loneliness, those who perceived more loneliness showed higher neural signature responses during social exclusion. These findings demonstrate that the neural signature of social exclusion is characterized by distributed networks of functional regions, especially the mentalizing and amygdala networks, and that older adults who are lonely may be more sensitive to being socially excluded.},

  title={Systemic Inflammation Accelerates Age-related Disintegration of Cognitive Control Networks},
  author={Naeun Oh and Kwak, S. and Kim, H. and Chey, J.},
  abstract={Background: Systemic inflammation is suggested to play a role in several neuropathological processes. However, the precise relation of inflammation and the functionality of the aging brain is still unclear. Cognitive control function is one of the heavily affected cognitive abilities in regards to normal aging and its neural correlates, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, are suggested to be impacted with aging. The aim of this study was to examine how levels of inflammatory markers impact the effect of aging on functional connectivity during a cognitive interference task. Method: Subjects were 89 healthy older adults (mean age= 70.8, SD= 6.2) participating in the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (KSHAP) without psychiatric or neurological diseases, traumatic brain injury, or loss of consciousness. Salivary C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was used as a marker of systemic inflammation and values were log transformed for analysis. Functional connectivity during the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) was assessed in a predefined seed region, namely dACC known to be associated with error detection. Result: CRP-by-age interaction was significantly associated with increased functional recruitment within the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and reduced deactivations of the default mode network (DMN). Specifically, older adults with higher levels of CRP showed stronger age-related reduction of connectivity between dACC and right insula of CON, compared to those with lower CRP levels. Regarding the DMN, older adults with higher levels of CRP showed stronger age-related decrease in anti-correlation between dACC and posterior cingulate compared to those with lower CRP levels. Conclusion: High levels of inflammation may deteriorate the functional utilization of cognitive control networks and may provide important physiological risk factors leading to cognitive deficits in later life. Learning Objectives: Identify the impact of systemic inflammation on age-related disruption of functional connectivity, Underline the importance of systemic inflammation as a physiological risk factor for cognitive deficits in later life.},

  title={Education Moderates the Relationship between Subjective Cognitive Decline and Inflammation in Older Adults},
  author={Naeun Oh and Kim, H. and Kwak, S. and Chey, J.},
  abstract={Subjective cognitive decline(SCD) is the feeling of the deterioration of cognitive functions in daily life, and is considered an early indicator of the progression of dementia pathology that may not be detected via objective testing. Especially in those with higher levels of education, the subtle decline of brain functions may not be detected in screening tests due to ceiling effects, thus SCD may be sensitive to these changes. In this study, we explored the relation between SCD and an inflammation marker C-reactive Protein(CRP), known as a risk factor of dementia, in order to verify the usefulness of SCD as a preclinical marker of dementia. We conducted surveys on SCD and collected salivary CRP levels of 105 healthy older adults. The level of CRP and SCD were not correlated directly but moderated by levels of education(r2=.0323 p<.05). Those with higher education levels showed increased SCD with increased CRP, whereas those with lower education levels did not show a significant relationship between the two. These findings suggest that the effect of inflammation on perceived decline in cognitive functions is stronger in those with higher education, implicating the importance of subjective cognitive decline as a sensitive marker of preclinical dementia.},
